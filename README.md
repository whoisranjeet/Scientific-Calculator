# Scientific Calculator

A modern, responsive scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, scientific functions, and keyboard input.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^)
- Scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, exp, sqrt)
- Parentheses support for complex expressions
- Negative number support
- Percentage calculations
- Keyboard input support
- Responsive design for all devices
- Clear and backspace functionality
- Error handling

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery 3.5.1
- Bootstrap 4.5.2

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Open `calculator.html` in a web browser

## Usage

### Mouse Input
- Click number buttons (0-9) to input numbers
- Click operation buttons (+, -, *, /, ^) for calculations
- Click scientific function buttons (sin, cos, tan, etc.) for advanced calculations
- Use parentheses for complex expressions
- Click '=' to see the result
- Click 'C' to clear all input
- Click 'CE' to clear current entry
- Click '⌫' to delete last character
- Click '±' to toggle between positive and negative numbers

### Keyboard Support
- Numbers: 0-9
- Operations: +, -, *, /, ^
- Decimal point: .
- Parentheses: (, )
- Enter: Calculate result
- Escape: Clear all
- Backspace: Delete last character

## Features in Detail

### Basic Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^)
- Percentage (%)

### Scientific Functions
- Sine (sin)
- Cosine (cos)
- Tangent (tan)
- Logarithm (log)
- Square Root (sqrt)
- Exponential (exp)

### Additional Features
- Parentheses for expression grouping
- Negative number support
- Decimal point support
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Error Handling

The calculator includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid expressions
- Division by zero
- Invalid scientific function inputs
- Malformed parentheses
- Invalid character inputs

## Browser Compatibility

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Responsive Design

The calculator is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers

- Different screen orientations

## Known Limitations

- Scientific functions work with radians for trigonometric calculations
- Maximum display length is limited to prevent overflow
- Complex numbers are not supported

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements:
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
- Degree/Radian toggle for trigonometric functions
- History of calculations
- Additional scientific functions
- Keyboard shortcuts for scientific functions
- Theme switcher (light/dark mode)
